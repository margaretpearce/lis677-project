    <p>The invention of the Internet has had a tremendous impact on society. It has changed nearly every aspect of modern life, including the way individuals communicate, do business, access information, and make decisions. Having the ability to go online can mean access to an education via online classes and distance learning programs, increased access to breaking world and local news, and online or work-from-home job opportunities. Developing countries building their citizens’ access to the Internet boosts their chances of achieving sustainable economic growth, according to a senior United Nations official [7]. On an individual level, a recent study has suggested that people with limited access to the Internet consider it as important as medicine and are more likely to agree that Internet access is necessary to survival [8].
    </p>

    <p>
        In this project, Internet usage, affordability, and quality are explored for countries in Southeast Asia. Countries in this region of the world are diverse in terms of economics, culture, geography, and history.
    </p>

    <p>
        For the purposes of this report, the following countries are considered to be in the Southeast Asia region: Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam.
    </p>

    <!-- Usage -->
    <div id="usage">
        <h3>Internet usage</h3>

        <p>
            In this section, we explore how many people have access to the Internet in each country in Southeast Asia. Internet users in this context are defined as individuals who have used the Internet in the last year from any location. Users could access the Internet through a variety of devices, such as a computer, a mobile phone, a PDA device, mobile broadband card, and so forth.
        </p>

        <p>
            For many countries, we observe the number of Internet users (per 100 people) increasing rapidly since the early 2000s and onward. Singapore, Brunei, and Malaysia show particularly high growth in the number of Internet users, surpassing the next highest country, Vietnam, by 20% (20 people per 100 people). However, countries with fewer users show slower growth over time. Myanmar, Cambodia, and Lao PDR remain below 15 Internet users per 100 people as of 2014.
        </p>

        <p>
            By contrast, we observe less of a divide among countries when comparing the number mobile cellular subscriptions per 100 people. Mobile cellular subscriptions are defined as a subscription to a mobile phone service that provide access to public switched telephone network (PSTN) via cellular technology. This includes postpaid subscriptions and active prepaid subscriptions, where active is defined as used within the last three months. Subscriptions via data cards, USB modems (VOIP), and subscriptions to public mobile data services are not included in this measure.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mapping the number of mobile cellular subscriptions (per 100 people), we can identify several countries that are lagging behind the rest of the region on the number of Internet users but surging ahead on the number of mobile subscribers. It is important to note that the measure for Internet users includes individuals who access the internet from a mobile device. Thus, the difference in the number of Internet users and the number of mobile cellular subscriptions suggests that many people either can’t or don’t access the Internet from their mobile devices.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is also interesting to observe that for many countries, the number of mobile cellular subscriptions per 100 people exceeds 100. In other words, some individuals have more than one mobile cellular subscriptions. According to The World Bank:
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>
                “The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimates that there were about 6 billion mobile subscriptions globally in the early 2010s. No technology has ever spread faster around the world. Mobile communications have a particularly important impact in rural areas. The mobility, ease of use, flexible deployment, and relatively low and declining rollout costs of wireless technologies enable them to reach rural populations with low levels of income and literacy. The next billion mobile subscribers will consist mainly of the rural poor…. If the service is not affordable to most people, goals of universal usage will not be met.”
            </i>
        </p>
    </div>


    <!-- Affordability -->
    <div id="affordability">
        <h3>Affordability</h3>

        <p>
            Next, we investigate the affordability of broadband and mobile cellular service in each country. To evaluate the affordability of these services, we must first explore the economic status of the region. Countries in Southeast Asia range greatly in terms of per capita income. Using data from 2014, the country with the lowest GNI per capita was Cambodia ($949 USD per person). Compared to the country with the highest GNI per capita, Singapore ($53,986 USD per person), GNI per capita in Cambodia was over 98% lower. The average GNI per capita in the region was $11,767.20 USD. Countries are classified as low income, lower-middle income, upper-middle income, or high income using cutoffs established by The World Bank [9].

        <p>
            It is important to distinguish between postpaid and prepaid mobile broadband services. According to ITU, prepaid prices are included in the data because they are often the only payment method available to low-income users, who may not have a regular income and thus won’t quality for a postpaid subscription. Broadband prices are further separated into three core groups:
            <ol>
            <li>Fixed broadband (e.g. home internet)
                </li>
            <li>Mobile broadband, computer-based (e.g. a mobile hotspot card)</li>
            <li>Mobile broadband, handset-based (e.g. a smart phone)</li>
            </ol>
            <br/>
            There are rules that qualify or disqualify individual plans from being included in the country averages. More details can be found in the ITU’S Measuring the Information Society Report 2015, Annex 3.

        </p>
        <br/>


        <p>
            Costs for each type of service and each payment method vary from one country to the next. In general, handset based mobile broadband is the cheapest option in terms of the % of GNI per capita. Fixed broadband services tend to be the highest priced option. However, data caps and speeds for each plan type are not equal: not all options give the same “bang for your buck”.
        </p>

        <p>
            Fixed broadband often advertise “unlimited” data, which means there is no cap on the amount of data usage in a month. Thus, fixed broadband plans may be the value best in terms of data for the money spent, particularly when the cost is not significantly higher than mobile options. Among mobile options, handset-based mobile broadband services tend to have higher data caps, often at lower prices compared to computer-based options. Many countries show little to no difference between prepaid and postpaid plans for a given service.
        </p>

        <p>
            As hinted by The World Bank, usage is linked to the affordability of broadband services. In fact, we can see a strong link between the cost of each service for the prepaid and postpaid plans and the number of Internet users per 100 people (p < 0.0001). Looking only at mobile broadband, we can see similar trends between the cost of mobile broadband services (prepaid and postpaid) and the number of mobile cellular subscriptions per 100 people (p < 0.0001).

        <h3>Quality</h3>
        <p>
            Finally, we explore the quality of mobile broadband services. For this section, we evaluate crowdsourced network statistics from each country using OpenSignal’s NetworkStats API. OpenSignal gets data from users opting into their app, which monitors the coverage and performance of mobile networks on physical devices around the world. For each country, we focus on network statistics in the capital city district. See notes in the Methodology section for more details.
        </p>

        <script type='text/javascript' src='https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'></script><div class='tableauPlaceholder' style='width: 982px; height: 742px;'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Number of Networks ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Nu&#47;NumberofNetworkProviders&#47;NumberofNetworks&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz' width='982' height='742' style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='NumberofNetworkProviders&#47;NumberofNetworks' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='no' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Nu&#47;NumberofNetworkProviders&#47;NumberofNetworks&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='showTabs' value='y' /></object></div>

        <p>
            First, we look at the variety of network providers captured from each capital city district. While the total number of network providers varies from one capital city to the next, within a capital city, networks also vary by type: 2G, 3G, or 4G, where “G” stands for generation. The 2G network type is the slowest (imagine using the Internet on a cell phone before smart phones) whereas 4G is the newest and fastest type. More 4G networks means that there is an increased likelihood of having faster service within the capital city. Furthermore, we can compare download and upload speed ranges by network type to highlight speed improvements for different network types.

        <p>Looking at the graphs, we can see sharp differences between network types in terms of speed. 2G networks are mere fractions of the download and upload speeds for 4G and even 3G networks. Significant speed improvements can be seen for 4G networks. For comparison purposes, note that Charter Spectrum Internet services in the Madison, Wisconsin area advertise a download speed of 60 Mbps and an upload speed of 4 Mbps.
        </p>

        <p>Download speeds in particular can have stark consequences for everyday Internet activity. To illustrate this point, consider the time it would take to perform common Internet tasks using the average speed among network providers on each network type in each country. Watching an hour-long HD video on Netflix can range from taking a matter of minutes to stream all of the data (4G) to hours upon hours (2G). Furthermore, activities that take too long may time out and disconnect before they are completed, in which case users may need to start the activity over from the beginning in the worst case.
        </p>

        <br/><br/>

        <p>
            However, speed is only one aspect of network quality. A network with fantastic speeds that drops all the time won’t let the user actually realize the top speeds. Therefore, we must also consider how reliable networks are as well as the strength of network signals.
        </p>

        <!-- network strength -->
        <script type='text/javascript' src='https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'></script><div class='tableauPlaceholder' style='width: 982px; height: 742px;'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Received signal strength by country, network ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Re&#47;ReceivedSignalStrength&#47;Receivedsignalstrengthbycountrynetwork&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz' width='982' height='742' style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='ReceivedSignalStrength&#47;Receivedsignalstrengthbycountrynetwork' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='no' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Re&#47;ReceivedSignalStrength&#47;Receivedsignalstrengthbycountrynetwork&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='showTabs' value='y' /></object></div>

        <br/><br/>

        <p>
            Overall, though 4G networks tend to be more reliable, their signal strength is lower than 2G and 3G options. This means that 4G networks are high quality, but they do not have as much coverage as older network types. This is not surprising given that 4G is the newest network type of the three, and therefore it may not be available as broadly yet. Overall, 3G tends to have the best service coverage. Finally, 2G tends to rank last in terms of reliability, but because of its status as an older generation network technology, it can outperform coverage of 4G.

        <h3>Methodology</h3>

        <h4>Data Sources</h4>
        <p>Data used in this project came from several distinct sources:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The World Bank<br/>
                The World Bank is an organization that offers support to developing countries through policy advice, research, and technical assistance. As part of this effort, The World Bank provides free access to comprehensive data sets about development and indicators on countries worldwide [1]. Data is available by country, by development indicators, by topic, or a la carte.
            </li><br/>
            <li>ITU’S Measuring the Information Society Report 2015<br/>
                ITU is a specialized agency within the United Nations for information and communication technologies (ICTs). One of the three sectors that ITU operates is the Telecommunication Development Sector, which publishes an annual report measuring the information society. The report includes data for 167 countries worldwide with data on pricing of mobile and broadband technologies, service levels, insights on overall development in each country pertaining to telecommunications, and comments on trends such as the Internet of Things. The appendix of the report details the methodology used to collect the data as well as criteria for inclusion/ exclusion for certain metrics.
                <br/><br/>
                Note: Several metrics used in The World Bank’s development indicators are sourced from ITU, including the number of Internet users (per 100 people), and The World Bank advises individuals utilizing these data to cite ITU. The World Bank data is used in this project for two reasons: 1) The World Bank provides data in a readily-consumable format (.csv, .xslx) rather than needing to extract it from a PDF report, and 2) The World Bank includes additional metrics not covered in ITU’s report, such as information on access to electricity.
            </li><br/>
            <li>OpenSignal<br/>
                OpenSignal publishes data on coverage and performance of mobile networks worldwide [3]. The data is obtained in a crowdsourced fashion using the OpenSignal app, which monitors the coverage and performance of mobile networks on physical devices around the world.  In exchange for providing signal statistics to OpenSignal, app users are given a toolkit to help them locate better connections in real time along with Wifi hotspots. The organization provides a free developer API [4], including a NetworkStats API that provides aggregate signal information by network name and type for a given area.
                One advantage of this source is that the data is obtained directly from users, increasing its integrity. However, the API does have several limitations: first, for non-commercial/ non-subscription users, only 5 requests are allowed per minute maxing out at 2000 requests per month. Second, each request must include a latitude and longitude center point and a bounding box distance (km). The API will return the average signal information in the area enclosed by the bounding box based on the center point. The bounding box size is limited to 10km x 10km.  Thus, combined with the restricted number of calls, only a certain amount of data can be reasonably obtained from the OpenSignal API without a paid plan, which starts at $10,000 for academic purposes. To address this issue, the project only considers capital cities for each country and uses city boundaries to determine how many API calls to make and which latitude/ longitude coordinates should be provided.
            </li><br/>
            <li>MapZen<br/>
                Leveraging OpenStreetMap, MapZen provides geojson files for each country. The files contain country, region, and city boundaries and are updated on a monthly basis as needed. City boundaries for each country in this project are used in connection with the OpenSignal API to obtain cell signal statistics for capital cities/ districts.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Data Wrangling</h4>
        <p>After obtaining the data, several processing steps were needed to arrange the data in a usable way. Steps varied depending on the source of the data:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>World Bank Data: Data downloaded from The World Bank website is saved with columns such as: Country Name, Series Name, 1999, 2000, …, 2014, 2015. To get the value for Mobile Cellular Subscriptions in 2010 in Brunei, you would look for a row where Country Name = Brunei, Series Name = Mobile Cellular Subscriptions, and then find the value under the column 2010. To make each series more accessible, particularly within Tableau, the data was split into separate files per series with the following column structure: Country Name, Country Code, Year, Series (e.g. Mobile Cellular Subscriptions). Missing series values, indicated by “..” in the original file, were excluded from the new files. Each newly generated file was saved according to the series name.
            </li><br/>
            <li>ITU’S Measuring the Information Society Report 2015: Because the report was released solely as a PDF, obtaining all data from the ITU report was done manually. Statistics used in the report (e.g. average broadband costs by country) were included as tables within the PDF, and the values were manually copied to an Excel file with one column for each statistic and one row for each country.
            </li><br/>
            <li>OpenSignal API: Data retrieved from the API is sent in the JSON format (JavaScript Object Notation). The JSON responses for each API query were stored the parsed into an Excel format for each of use with Tableau.
            </li><br/>
            <li>MapZen: Within the set of geojson files for each country, the boundaries for each capital city district were located and used with the Google Maps JavaScript API to outline on a map. This generated a visualization which helped identify the boundaries of latitude and longitude coordinates to use with the OpenSignal API. Using the drawn boundary as a guide, a simplistic polygon was fit along the city outline. When searching for coordinates, the polygon simplifies the mathematical checks to determine whether or not the point lies inside the region.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The process of determining which API calls to make against OpenSignal API took advange of the fact that city boundaries were known from MapZen. The methodology is as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Draw the boundaries of capital city districts using data from MapZen
            </li>
            <li>
                Draw a simplified polygon representing the boundary on the same map
            </li>
            <li>
                Identify the search region as the smallest rectangular area containing the simplified polygon
            </li>
            <li>
                Starting from the top left corner, sketch bounding boxes of size 10km x 10km within the rectangular area.
            </li>
            <li>
                For each bounding box, determine if the center point lies within the simplified polygon boundary. If so, save the center point to a list of coordinates to pass to the OpenSignal API.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>To ensure that each data point returned from OpenSignal has an equal weight in terms of the square kilometers that it corresponds to, the same size bounding box was used for each country’s capital city (10km x 10km). As a result, the number of API calls for a given capital city varied from one country to the next and is proportionate to the size (in square kilometers) of the city. For instance, there was only one API request made for Manila in the Philippines, but there were 37 made for Vientiane (Laos). There is a margin of error for each city: some bounding boxes may be partially outside of the city boundaries, and some areas within the city are not covered by any bounding boxes. There is a tradeoff between the size of the bounding boxes and the margin of error. For this project, the bounding box size was chosen such that the number of API calls was minimized while obtaining sufficient city coverage. Bounding box coverage maps are available with the project data files [6].</p>
